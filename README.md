## Public projects

### NC News 
NC News was a **Solo Project** I built during a Northcorders bootcamp. Now it has a completely functioning database and backend. The frontend is coming soon. All the endpoints are tested with Jest, and they also have effective error handling including user friendly error messages and appropriate status codes. Used: JS, PSQL, EXPRESS JS, HTML, CSS.

### Online IQ test web app
Before bootcamp, I built an IQ Test web app using TypeScript + Next.js, Supabase Postgres/Edge Functions, Stripe, and an AI summary feature via Google Gemini (prompt engineering). I relied on AI tools for most of the TypeScript code back then; **I’m keeping it public specifically to show my baseline and how much my engineering approach has improved since** (structure, testing, and best practices).

### DriftDraft Website Planner App
AI-Powered Website Planner (pre-bootcamp, AI-assisted) — An early-stage tool I built to speed up discovery calls for websites. Users answer a guided set of questions; AI helps turn rough notes into clear, marketing-aware requirements, then generates a detailed spec document with suggested wireframes and recommendations (SEO, ads, content and structure) that’s easier for a developer to implement. Includes a subscription-style credits + rate-limiting system (anonymous vs free vs paid tiers), implemented with Supabase Auth + RLS, JWT-authenticated API calls, and scheduled credit resets via cron. This was built before my bootcamp and involved heavy AI assistance; **I’m keeping it public to show my baseline and how much my engineering practices have improved since.**
